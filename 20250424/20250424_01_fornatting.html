        <b>The</b> snow glows white on the mountain tonight <br>
        Not a footprint to be seen <br>
        A kingdom of isolation <br>
        And it looks like I'm the queen <br>
        The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside <br>
        Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried <br>
        Don't let them in, don't let them see <br>
        Be the good girl you always have to be <br>
        Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know <br>
        Well, now they know <br>
        Let it go, let it go <br>
        Can't hold it back anymore <br>
        Let it go, let it go <br>
        Turn away and slam the door <br>
        I don't care what they're going to say <br>
        Let the storm rage on <br>
        The cold never bothered me anyway <br>
